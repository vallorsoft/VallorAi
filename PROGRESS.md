# AI Home Designer — Build Progress

> Last updated: 2026-07-07 (BIM-detail feature, steps 0-4 done)

## Live status
- **API**: https://vallorai-api.fly.dev/api/v1 — deployed, stable
- **Web**: https://vallorai.fly.dev — deployed, stable
- **DB**: Neon PostgreSQL, 13 tables pushed; `db-push` job runs automatically on every deploy
- **Auth**: register + login confirmed working end-to-end on the live site
- **AI provider**: Gemini (default), Claude and OpenAI adapters also wired in
- Nothing beyond signup/login has been exercised live yet — projects, editor, AI chat, costs, exports all exist in code but are unverified in production.

## Spec audit & roadmap (2026-07-07)

13 PDF specs uploaded to `docs/materials/` were processed and cross-checked against
the codebase (see `Master p.PDF`/`Master 2.PDF` note below). A phased roadmap was
produced reconciling the specs' vision with what's actually built; full detail lives
in the session's plan, condensed here as Phase 0/1 below. Two files
(`Master p.PDF`, `Master 2.PDF`) contain AI-agent prompt-injection style text, not
genuine specs — their literal instructions are not followed; their product content
(manufacturer schema etc.) is noted only as background for a future marketplace phase.

### Phase 0 — Baseline hygiene — DONE

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Real Prisma migrations (`packages/database/prisma/migrations/`, baselined as `20260707052955_init`) | ✅ |
| Jest unit test harness for `apps/api` (`RulesService` coverage) | ✅ |
| Jest e2e smoke test harness for `apps/api` (auth guard + register flow) | ✅ |
| CI: `db-push` job replaced with `db-migrate` (`prisma migrate deploy`) | ✅ (code) — **manual one-time step still required**, see below |

**Action required before the next deploy runs**: production's Neon DB already has the
`init` schema plus the email-verification columns (both applied via the old `db push`
step — the latter from #22/#23). Prisma has no migration history for either yet. Before
`db-migrate` runs for real, resolve these two (via the "Baseline Prisma Migrations"
manual workflow, or by hand with the production `DATABASE_URL`):
```
pnpm --filter @ai-home-designer/database exec prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260707052955_init
pnpm --filter @ai-home-designer/database exec prisma migrate resolve --applied 20260707055000_add_email_verification
```
Do **not** resolve `20260707060241_add_project_versioning_and_password_reset` — those
tables are genuinely new and must be created for real by `migrate deploy`. Skipping the
two resolves above makes the first `migrate deploy` fail (it will try to re-create
tables/columns that already exist). This was deliberately not run by the agent — it
touches the live production database and needs a human with real prod credentials (or
the manual GitHub Actions workflow, which uses the existing `DATABASE_URL` secret).

### Phase 1 — Foundation correctness — MOSTLY DONE

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Response envelope `{success,data,meta}` (interceptor + exception filter, `@SkipEnvelope()` for the AI SSE stream) | ✅ |
| Auth hardening: `POST /auth/forgot-password`, `POST /auth/reset-password` (`PasswordResetToken` model; email send is a logged stub pending Phase 5.5 Brevo) | ✅ |
| Project versioning: `ProjectVersion` snapshot on every House mutation, `GET /projects/:id/versions`, `POST /projects/:id/versions/:id/restore` (transactional, non-destructive) | ✅ |
| AI system prompt language fix (`getSystemPrompt` now honors `ro`/`en`/`hu`, was previously hardcoded to Romanian) | ✅ |
| AI JSON response validation (zod schema + code-fence stripping, stored in `Message.metadata`, degrades gracefully) | ✅ |
| `ProjectRole`/`ProjectPermission` for per-project sharing | ⬜ **pending product-owner sign-off** — is project sharing wanted yet? |

Known gap noted during implementation, not yet fixed: `houses.controller.ts` endpoints
(room/wall mutations) still have no project-ownership check at the `houseId`/`roomId`
level — only the new `/projects/:id/versions*` endpoints inherit an ownership check
(via `ProjectsService`). Worth closing before/alongside `ProjectPermission`.

See session plan for full detail and the items needing
explicit business sign-off before starting.

## Phase 5.5 — Email (Brevo) — DONE (merged via #22/#23, in parallel with the spec-audit work above)

Full email verification before first login, using Brevo as the transactional
email provider. **Emails go out using Brevo's own default/system sender template
for now** — no custom HTML design yet. Swapping in a branded Romanian-language
template is a separate, later task once the product has real users.

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Add `verificationToken` + `verificationTokenExpiresAt` to `User` model | ✅ |
| `MailModule`/`MailService` — thin wrapper over Brevo's transactional email REST API (`api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/email`), no new SDK dependency (uses native `fetch`) | ✅ |
| `register()`: create user as unverified, generate token, send verification email, do **not** issue JWT yet — return a "check your email" response instead | ✅ |
| `login()`: reject with a clear error if `isVerified` is false | ✅ |
| `POST /auth/verify-email` — validates token + expiry, sets `isVerified = true`, issues JWT tokens | ✅ |
| `POST /auth/resend-verification` — regenerates token, resends email (covers expired/lost emails) | ✅ |
| `BREVO_API_KEY`, `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL` — Fly.io secrets + `.env.example` | ✅ |
| Web: `/verify-email?token=...` page that calls the endpoint and logs the user in on success | ✅ |

Note: this branched (via `db push --accept-data-loss`) at the same time as the spec-audit
Phase 0/1 work above, which independently moved to real Prisma migrations. The
`verificationToken`/`verificationTokenExpiresAt` columns were folded into the migration
history as `20260707055000_add_email_verification` (sequenced between `init` and the
versioning migration to match what's actually on production) when the two branches merged.

## Phase 7 — BIM-level detail (brick/rebar-level 2D/3D) — IN PROGRESS

Prioritized by the product owner ahead of the remaining Phase 2 items (DXF export, geometry
validation), which are paused until this lands. Full technical detail and rationale now lives
in `CLAUDE.md`'s "BIM-detail feature" section (the original planning doc lived outside the git
repo and did not persist between sessions — `CLAUDE.md` is the durable reference from here on).

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 0 | Research real RO/HU standards for brick/rebar/plaster/insulation defaults (no invented values) | ✅ |
| 1 | Data model: `Material`/`AssemblyLayer`/`ReinforcementSpec`/`Foundation` + migration + seed (9 `GENERIC_DEFAULT` materials incl. Leiertherm 38 N+F) | ✅ |
| 2 | `packages/bim-engine` — masonry running-bond + longitudinal rebar quantity/layout calc, own build step, wired into both Dockerfiles | ✅ |
| 3 | 2D wall layer-inspector panel (`WallLayerPanel.tsx`), click-to-select wall, i18n'd, browser-verified RO/HU/EN | ✅ |
| 4 | Cost engine BOQ integration — real per-material lines replace flat masonry/plastering/painting/insulation rates once wall data exists | ✅ |
| 5 | React Three Fiber viewer foundation (extruded-box walls, LOD scaffold, no brick detail yet) | ⬜ |
| 6 | Brick coursing + instancing for opening-free walls, perf-validated on one wall first | ⬜ |
| 7 | Opening-aware cut-brick generation (centimeter-precise, anchored from openings) — biggest remaining engineering risk | ⬜ |
| 8 | Longitudinal rebar instancing | ⬜ |
| 9 | Stirrup/bent rebar geometry (distinct from longitudinal, separate calc + instance pool) | ⬜ |

Also still open: the new migration `20260707071500_add_material_assembly_reinforcement` has
not yet been applied to production Neon (needs the same manual baseline/deploy treatment as
the Phase 0 migrations, via the existing `db-baseline-migrations.yml` workflow, once this
branch merges to `main`).

## Next immediate steps
1. **Email verification via Brevo** (Phase 5.5 above) — blocks trusting who's actually registering
2. Manually exercise every live feature end-to-end (projects CRUD, editor canvas, AI chat, cost estimate, exports) and fix whatever breaks — none of it has been tested against the real deployed DB yet
3. Cloudflare R2 for file/photo storage (Plot photos, exported documents)
4. Wire AI chat to update the floor plan canvas when a `design_update` payload comes back
5. Revisit Phase 6 feature list with the client and prioritize
